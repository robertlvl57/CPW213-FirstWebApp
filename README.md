# CPW213-EmptyWebsite-StarterCode
Contains a little bit more of a start than the empty template in Visual Studio. 
This is useful to build an ASP.NET MVC Core website almost completely from scratch to understand all the components we are using and
to start understanding the MVC pattern and how ASP.NET projects work by default

## Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2017+ with the ASP.NET & Web Development workload installed
- [.NET Core SDK 2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
